Пояснения от нейронки:
The issue you're describing — the menu being initially visible with a transition when it shouldn't — is a common problem caused by the lack of initial visibility control or inconsistent initial transform state when media queries kick in.

✅ Root Cause:
The menu is always display: flex, even before JavaScript toggles the open class. This means it's rendered and styled immediately, including the transition from translateY(-150%). So when the page loads below 768px, it transitions from its starting position, making it momentarily visible.

✅ Fix:
You need to hide the menu initially below 768px using an opacity or visibility: hidden, then show it only when .open is applied. Also, avoid relying on just transform for visibility.

✅ Summary:
-Added opacity and pointer-events to ensure the menu is hidden and non-interactive by default.
-.menu.open reveals it smoothly.
-This avoids the flash of the menu appearing on initial page load at smaller viewports.
